# fitness-tracker
For this assignment we were creating the API routes, HTML routes, and some other aspects of this fitness application tracker. For this assignment we were creating the database through mongodb and mongoose. To create the API routes I followed the demonstrated routes from the client side code. The routes for the HTML were / for the index page, /stats, for the stats page, and /workouts for the workouts page. I then had to put together a server.js page that would create the local connection, or the connection to heroku.

## Getting Started

$ brew install git. 
```
Homebrew can also be downloaded by inputting the following command in the terminal:
